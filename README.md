Game and Grade 
================

## Summary

***Write-up of your project and findings go here. Think of this as the text
of your presentation. The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read
out loud. Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750
words. To use the word count addin, select the text you want to count
the words of (probably this is the Summary section of this document, go
to Addins, and select the `Word count` addin). This addin counts words
using two different algorithms, but the results should be similar and as
long as you’re in the ballpark of 750 words, you’re good! The addin will
ignore code chunks and only count the words in prose.

You can also load your data here and present any analysis results /
plots, but I strongly urge you to keep that to a minimum (maybe only the
most important graphic, if you have one you can choose). And make sure
to hide your code with `echo = FALSE` unless the point you are trying to
make is about the code itself. Your results with proper output and
graphics go in your presentation, this space is for a brief summary of
your project.***

My name is Carolyn Powers and this is my final project for DSCI 151.  I have done my project on how video games can affect the academic performance of children, if at all.  I will use the terms:  Average score and grade interchangeably throughout the presentation.  This is the dataset I have chosen and the one variable that I have found particularly interesting through the dataset is the father education and the mother education, which I have combined into a new variable called parent education.  I also found it very interesting to see the ways that parent education can influence child education and what they allow their children to do.  
As with any study, it’s important that we always discuss the roadblocks and things that can get in the way or make the results of this study possibly inaccurate.  And that’s why I’ve included this ‘limitations’ slide in my presentation.  The first limitation that I found is the frequency.  There is less data on some schools than others and on other variables in the dataset.  As a result, this may skew the data or make it appear in a way that’s inaccurate.  The second of these is “good games”  Recent studies have shown that surgeons can benefit from playing video games as it improves their fine motor skills and I think that’s certainly a good thing, as they have a very stressful job working in people’s bodies and using their fine motor skills all day.  The second of these “good games” is benefitting children with ADHD as this can increase their attention span and cognitive function.  I think this is also certainly a good thing.  But I just want to clarify that this study specifically focuses on video games and while the data does not specifically specify whether they’re considered good games or bad games, it does highlight how it affects the academic success of students.
As you can see, those who do play video games have a lower academic score than those who don’t play video games.  At first glance, it may appear that video games negatively impact success in education.  However, as we learned in this course, it’s important to dig deeper and compare this to the other variables in the dataset to confirm our hypothesis.  There are 11 schools that have participated in this study and as we can see, some schools have a higher grade on average than others.  For example, schools 6 and 7 already have higher grades, whereas school 3 has a lower grade in general.  It’s important that we understand this and how this could also affect the outcome of the data.  Here, we have a bar chart of the average score based on the number of hours of video games that were played per day.  This visualization clearly shows the correlation between hours played and average grades, with the academic score decreasing with the increase of hours played per day.  I believe that this indicates that videogames do indeed impact grades, with the decrease of roughly 2 points per 2 hours played.  
Here, it becomes clear that boys on average spend more time playing video games as opposed to girls.  As you can see, the average scores of girls are slightly higher in general.  I believe that this could possibly be correlated to the amount of video games played per day.
Next, we will explore how parents' annual income and education affect the grades of their children.  This visualization shows that the more educated parents are, the higher the average score of their children. This may be because they care about education more, or have passed these kinds of scholarly values to their children.  Do more educated parents allow their children to play less?  According to this graph, there doesn’t appear to be a relationship between the number of hours children played per day and parent education.  Again, there may be no relationship between these values, or we may be running into one of the limitations discussed earlier.
Finally, we will look at how the annual income of parents affects the average grades of children.  It appears that the higher the annual income of a family is, the better the grades of children are.  It’s important to address this first bar here on the left.  It’s possible that this is an outlier, or it could be that children whose families have lower income care more about their education.  
It is clear to me that parent education can affect the education of their children.  However, this may not be directly correlated with video games.  
In conclusion, I believe that how many hours a child spends on video games does affect their academic performance.  However, I do not believe that parents have much effect on how long their child plays the video games based on this data.
Thank you for watching my presentation.  I personally found this project very interesting and I am thankful that I learned how to use this data to understand real life situations.  As a future educator, I want to be able to understand as much about my future students as possible.  Being able to analyze this data has taught me that there are so many factors that can influence a child’s academic performance.  I truly hope that you have found this information as interesting as I have.  Thank you.
